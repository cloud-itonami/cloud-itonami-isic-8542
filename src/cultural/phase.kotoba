  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the cultural-education analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-8620`'s `clinic.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- student intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds curriculum verification +
                                 child-performer-permit screening
                                 writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:student/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 finalize-certification` NEVER auto-
                                 commits, at any phase.

  `:actuation/finalize-certification` is deliberately ABSENT from
  every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Finalizing
  a real certification or progress record is the ONE real-world act
  this actor performs; it is always a human licensed-educator call.
  `cultural.governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-certification` high-
  stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this. `:permit/screen` is likewise never
  auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture every sibling's
  screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member
  (`:student/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-capital-risk
  'file' lifecycle distinct from the student itself.")
